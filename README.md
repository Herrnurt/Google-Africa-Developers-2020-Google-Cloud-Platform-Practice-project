# GADS-GCP-Practice-Project-Submission

Google Africa Developer Scholarship Phase II

Google Cloud Practice Project

# Description

During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program shall be encouraged to explore  the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.

Due to limitations in regards to accessing free Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Google Cloud challenge is based on the available hands-on labs on Qwiklabs provided by Pluralsight. Learners in the Cloud track have free access to a selection of fundamental labs on GCP.


# The playground

All Google Cloud learners have access to multiple learning channels on Pluralsight. Each channel provides access to several video courses, and you have access to various labs through Qwiklabs.
The total of **hands-on labs is 168 labs** (as of writing).


#  challenge(s)

The Cloud challenge is divided in two parts:

    1. Complete of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received.
    
    2. “Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.
    
 # The learning aspects
 
Professional cloud engineers use a lot of automation and therefore scripting of solutions instead of clicking around in the UI of the web administration. Also using git and version control to store and monitor those scripts is a common use case.

Learners are gently guided towards this professional handling using both approaches. The translation of Cloud Console instructions to easy to use commands in the Cloud Shell helps to foster the understanding and knowledge of cloud computing in GCP.

Selection of labs shall be based on the curriculum and ofØcial study guide of the ACE exam as described by Google on their certiØcation website.

Furthermore Qwiklabs hosts Speedrun competitions regularly and promotes them on Twitter and Medium. Without knowledge and use of CLI tools participants cannot compete in those Speedruns.
